  "summary": "The BuildRequest contains no explicit requirements (and indicates the Great Follower Wall collage + per-name hover effects already exist). The diff introduces/changes multiple frontend and backend behaviors (new FollowerWall component, new aggregated-followers hook, CSS hover/animation styling, and significant backend follower/profile APIs). With no stated requirements, these appear to be unrequested additions relative to the BuildRequest.",

      "description": "Added a new Great Follower Wall background component that renders all follower names with pseudo-random positioning/rotation/scale and CSS-variable driven hover color.",
      "reason": "No requirements were specified; the BuildRequest also states the wall collage + per-name hover effects are already implemented existing features, so adding a new component implementation is not requested.",
